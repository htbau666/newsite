# Cybersecurity Club Website

This repository contains the source code for the student-run cybersecurity club website, a platform to foster skills in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity through hands-on challenges, workshops, and events.

## About Our Club
Our cybersecurity club is a vibrant, student-led community dedicated to advancing knowledge and expertise in cybersecurity. We focus on practical, hands-on learning through activities like Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, workshops, and collaborative projects. Members engage in challenges covering areas such as password cracking, network security, web application testing, and secure coding practices. The club organizes regular events, including guest lectures, hackathons, and skill-building sessions, to promote continuous learning. We also recruit for various roles, such as technical, design, organizing, logistics, and social media teams, to drive innovative projects and foster a supportive environment for all skill levels, from beginners to advanced practitioners.
